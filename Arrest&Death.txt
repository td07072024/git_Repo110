Sen stayed in hiding, and kept moving from one place to another. Sometimes he took up a job as a workman, a farmer, a priest, a house worker or even hid as a pious Muslim. This is how he avoided being captured by the British.[13]

Masterda Surya Sen's letter to his elder brother, Chandra kumar Sen

Surya Sen's letter to his sister in law, Birajmohini devi
He hid in the house of a friend. His relative named Netra Sen lived not far away.[14] But Netra Sen informed the British of his hiding place, and the police came and captured him in February 1933.[14] Before Netra Sen could be rewarded by the British, revolutionaries named Kironmoy Sen along with Rabindra Nandi came into his house and beheaded him with da (a long knife).[15][16][17] As Netra Sen's wife was a big supporter of Surya Sen, she never disclosed the name of the revolutionaries who killed Netra Sen. Before his eventual hanging on 12 January 1934 with another revolutionary named Tarakeswar Dastidar, both Sen and Dastidar underwent torture at the hands of the police.[16]

His last letter was written to his friends and said: "Death is knocking at my door. My mind is flying away towards eternity. At such a pleasant, at such a grave, at such a solemn moment, what shall I leave behind you? Only one thing, that is my dream, a golden dream â€“ the dream of free India. Never forget the date, 18th of April, 1930, the day of the eastern Rebellion in Chittagong. Write in red letters in the core of your hearts the names of the patriots who have sacrificed their lives at the altar of India's freedom."[18]
